My name is Emeka Hillary.
I am enthusiastic about data security in industrial controls system. 
I set up and trobleshoot Industrial controls systems like PLC, DCS and SCADA and also help organizations increase safety goals and meet production KPIs in production and manufacturing environments.
I believe that expanding the ability of monitoring and remotely controlling critical assets will help increase the safety of these critical assets. 
With my problem solving, programming, learning and communication skills, SCADA IT/OT interests me.
